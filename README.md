I built a classic Minesweeper game in C++ using `ncurses`, so you can play it directly in your terminal. It was a great learning experience and really satisfying to see in action. I developed this project during the summer of 2025.

![Demo](https://github.com/Sai-Prabhav/tui_mine/blob/main/tuimine.png?raw=true)

To run the program first install `ncurses` and `g++`. Then run `g++ main.cpp minesweeper.cpp -o mine -lncurses` in the cloned directory.
